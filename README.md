# Edit-Distance-and-Palindromes

Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. 
Different types of edit distances allow different sets of string operations. 
In this project, two edit distances were designed and palindromes were made by using those edit distances:

- LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) distance
- Levenshtein distance: the minimum number of single-character edits by insertion, deletion, and substitution required to change one word into the other.
